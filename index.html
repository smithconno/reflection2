  The hardest thing I have learned and now understand is the complex css commands used to move the blocks, for example. On the lab where we had to move the different colored boxes using commands such as floating, height and width, and padding, I worked on the lab with my partner, J, and did not know exactly what to do for some of the more complicated examples so J helped me to understand what to do. I was then able to help Mason understand the concept of how to use those things properly. He understood how to change the height and width of each of the boxes, and could float a few of the boxes properly, but he could not get it finished so I gave him a few pointers and he got it all figured out.

    One thing I am having trouble with is the complex parts of javascript, such as d3 mean. I did not fully understand hardly any of the javascript before last week when I came to meet with you, but now I understand the basic points of java. I do not understand the more complex parts of java yet, but once I keep meeting with you, it should all start making more sense. My issue is that it all builds off of each other so until I fully understand the more basic parts of java I will not understand the more complex commands. Also, even when I know what to do regarding java, I have trouble knowing the right spot for the command to go.
